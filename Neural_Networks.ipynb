Each neural network consists of a sequence of layers in which data passes through. These layers are made up on neurons and the neurons of one layer are connected to the next (see below). These connections are defined by what we call a weight (some numeric value). Each layer also has something called a bias, this is simply an extra neuron that has no connections and holds a single numeric value. Data starts at the input layer and is trasnformed as it passes through subsequent layers. The data at each subsequent neuron is defined as the following.\n",

In this case we will simply scale all our greyscale pixel values (0-255) to be between 0 and 1. We can do this by dividing each value in the training and testing sets by 255.0.
